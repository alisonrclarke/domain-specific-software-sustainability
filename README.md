This is a repository to store useful links etc relating to my [SSI Fellowship](https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme) in Domain-Specific Software Sustainability Training.

Currently I'm using the [wiki](https://github.com/alisonrclarke/domain-specific-software-sustainability/wiki) to store useful links and a [project board](https://github.com/alisonrclarke/domain-specific-software-sustainability/projects/1) to keep track of tasks.
