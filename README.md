This is a repository to store useful links etc relating to my [SSI Fellowship](https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme) in Domain-Specific Software Sustainability Training.

Currently I'm using the [wiki](https://github.com/alisonrclarke/domain-specific-software-sustainability/wiki) to store useful links and a [project board](https://github.com/alisonrclarke/domain-specific-software-sustainability/projects/1) to keep track of tasks.

## Scripts

The scripts directory will hold any useful code snippets and tools I create along the way.

### QGIS Processing history

I create a script `convert_history_to_python.py` which converts QGIS processing history to an executable
python script to allow others to reproduce your work. It has been moved to a new git repository at https://github.com/alisonrclarke/reproducible-qgis.
